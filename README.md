Revenue Prediction for Revenue Services Lesotho (RSL)
Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for Revenue Services Lesotho (RSL) to predict tax revenues from income, profits, and capital gains for the fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 based on historical data. The accurate prediction of tax revenues is crucial for RSL to effectively plan and allocate resources for public services, infrastructure development, and socioeconomic programs in the Kingdom of Lesotho.

Problem Statement
Efficient revenue collection and tax administration are essential for the fiscal sustainability and economic stability of Lesotho. RSL requires a predictive model that can forecast tax revenues accurately, taking into account various economic and policy factors. The model should be able to handle missing data, perform feature engineering, and provide insights into the most influential features for revenue prediction.

Dataset Overview
The dataset provided contains information on various tax revenues for multiple years, including features such as corporate tax rates, personal income tax rates, capital gains tax rates, and other relevant variables. The dataset enables us to analyze historical trends in tax revenues and identify patterns that can help predict future revenue outcomes.

Machine Learning Model
We developed a machine learning model using supervised learning techniques to predict tax revenues for the upcoming fiscal years. The model employs regression algorithms to estimate revenue values based on input features such as tax rates, economic indicators, and government policies. Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and feature engineering were performed to enhance model performance.

Web Application
To facilitate easy access to the predictive model, we have developed a web application using Streamlit. Users can input relevant features such as the level of government, revenue category, and year, and the application will provide a prediction of tax revenues for the specified parameters.

How to Use the Web Application
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the app.py script using the command streamlit run app.py.
Select the level of government, revenue category, and year from the dropdown menus.
Click the "Predict" button to view the predicted tax revenue for the specified parameters.
Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to Revenue Services Lesotho (RSL) for providing the dataset and valuable insights for this project. Additionally, we acknowledge the support of our team members and advisors who contributed to the development and implementation of the predictive model.
